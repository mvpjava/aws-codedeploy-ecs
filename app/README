1) build_and_run.sh 2.0
   - specify new version number as input arg (defaults to version 1.0)
   - uses Dockerfile to create a new docker image and then tags it with specified version #
   - Also created another tag with same version # for aws ecr
   - updates index.html with new version number to be displayed in HTML (used to confirm deployment of new version)
   - will call push-to-ecr.sh

2) update-task-definition.sh
   - substitutes the newly build image name (ECR URI) into template task-new-rev-def-template.json
   - registered new task revision with ecs

3) update-appspec.sh
   - will make aws ecs cli command to get new task definition arn, docker container name and port and update appspec.json
